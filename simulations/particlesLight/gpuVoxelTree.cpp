 * Purpose: The class included in this file serves to represent a voxel based
 *          3D model on the GPU similar to that of OpenVDB. The data structure
 *          consists of tiers, each of which splits up the active space of
 *          interest into different sized cells. The lowest level contains the
 *          actual voxel data. The design of this data structure is simply to
 *          answer the question "is particle x inside a voxel?", and thus it is
 *          meant to be used primarily with particle simulations on the GPU.
